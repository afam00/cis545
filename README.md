# cis545

Personal code for CIS 545 Big Data Analytics (Fall 2018) assignments. Main code is found in the Jupyter notebooks.
Used python (ipython, numpy, pandas), SQL, Spark, Google Cloud, and Tensorflow.

<br />HW1-1:   data wrangling & cleaning (of OpenFlights.org data, e.g. using nltk package)
<br />HW1-2:   SQL operations (OpenFlights.org data, e.g. finding delayed flights by airline, fastest multi-flight routes)
<br />HW1-adv: comprehensive SQL operations
<br />HW2:  basic graph operations (metadata & traversals)
<br />HW2-adv:  implementing page rank algorithm via graph traversal (breadth first search - see HW3 for cleaner implementation)
<br />HW3:  basic image operations, page rank algorithm, spark distributed computations on Google Cloud Platform
<br />HW3-adv:  NLP text analysis

<br />Final project:  image recognition with limited datasets using Siamese convolutional neural networks
